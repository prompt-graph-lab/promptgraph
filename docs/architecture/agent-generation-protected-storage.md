# Agent Generation protected-storage characterization (C2B-8C-1 / C2B-8C-2)

`core/generation_protected_storage.py` characterizes the protected-storage policy
required by the [Ownership Journal](agent-generation-ownership-journal.md),
[containment](agent-generation-output-containment.md), durable asset promotion
and [Human Recovery](agent-generation-human-recovery.md). It has **no production
call site**. `execution_available` and every execution, association, publication,
save and cleanup status remain false. Recovery remains inspect-only.
`core/generation_windows_protected_storage.py` adds a separate opt-in native
Windows observation owner for narrowly supported disposable roots.
`core/generation_protected_journal.py` adds an offline disposable Journal lifecycle
over that native owner and the existing Journal and Human Recovery inspection
owners. It has no production call site; containment, promotion and execution
remain unconnected.

## Threat model and separate evidence

The foundation distinguishes accidental corruption, another-user filesystem
access, same-user writers, path substitution, interrupted writes and unsupported
storage. Privileged administrators, SYSTEM, compromised host code and hardware
failure are not authenticated or isolated by this foundation. Even a later
owner-only ACL cannot distinguish legitimate host code from another process
running with that user's token. No secrets, HMAC keys, signatures, encryption,
DPAPI-backed identity or trusted author are introduced.

| Observation or future gate | Meaning | Does not imply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observed root/file identity | Same Python `st_dev/st_ino` at bounded path checks | Handle-pinned access, verified ACL, trusted writer or freshness between checks |
| Verified ACL snapshot (native disposable owner only) | Complete bounded modeled owner-only DACL on the pinned object | Authentication of another process using the same user token or general effective-access certification |
| File integrity | Existing C2B-8A byte/hash/image checks agree | Authenticated source or current runtime custody |
| Digest-chain validity | Internal ordered journal hashes agree | Author authentication or latest-state proof |
| Trusted latest head (unavailable here) | Independently retained revision/digest can detect a valid older prefix | Authentication without separately trusted head custody |
| Authorship authentication (unverified here) | Separately designed trusted writer policy | Current Project/source/session/activation/pairing authorization |
| Current authorization (absent here) | Separately reviewed fresh host capability | Authority derived from paths, ACLs, checksums, IDs or human inspection |

A same-user writer can replace journal contents and recompute every SHA-256.
Tests demonstrate a digest-valid changed process identity and a valid rollback
without a retained latest head. Both reopen as unauthenticated inspect-only
evidence. A retained expected tip detects rollback without establishing
authorship. Neither policy-compatible synthetic ACL samples nor successful
filesystem observations are accepted as an authenticity upgrade.

## Explicit disposable purpose roots

`ProtectedStorageCharacterization.capture_for_characterization` requires both
`characterization=True` and `disposable_opt_in=True`, an existing canonical
absolute disposable scope and exactly four independently supplied purpose paths:

| Purpose | Allowed observation |
| --- | --- |
| `private_journal` | Existing private journal directory identity |
| `temporary_containment` | Existing staging/containment directory identity |
| `promoted_assets` | Existing durable asset directory identity |
| `selected_project_json` | Exact original selected Project JSON identity; reference only |

All paths must be strict descendants of the opt-in scope. Purposes cannot alias
or nest within each other. Journal-supplied paths, inferred active/last Projects,
OS temp discovery and arbitrary user directories are not accepted. Outside
paths and missing/extra purposes are rejected before filesystem probing. The
caller supplies the original selected JSON independently of journal contents;
the owner does not select, read, change or save its contents. The disposable
contract intentionally does not admit a real Project outside the scope.

Capture and recheck use `lstat` on every ancestor, including the drive root,
refuse symlinks and Windows reparse points (including junctions), require
ordinary directories/files, reject multiply linked selected files, and compare
original scope/root/file identities. Substituting a directory or identical
selected JSON bytes does not recapture identity. No recursive scan, content
read, allocation, ACL change, deletion or transport occurs. These path checks
detect observed substitutions; they do not close hostile check/use races.
That limitation keeps protected-storage capability unavailable.

`readiness()` returns a detached bounded projection: four purpose rows, fixed
identity/ACL/integrity states, platform/backend blockers and separate trust gates.
It exposes no paths, device/inode values, SIDs, process/claim/session IDs,
exceptions, payloads, credentials or endpoint information. ACL/integrity/chain/
authorization are never inferred from unchanged identity. Missing, inaccessible,
reparse and changed objects remain closed. All non-Windows platforms are
unsupported. This path/stat owner reports `native_observation_required` on
Windows; it never infers native guarantees. A separate native owner's projection
can report a verified ACL snapshot while overall protected-storage readiness
and all execution/Recovery gates stay false.

## Windows capability evaluation and precise unsupported boundary

Windows offers handle-oriented APIs. The evaluated host exposes `CreateFileW`,
`GetFileInformationByHandleEx`, `GetVolumeInformationByHandleW`,
`FlushFileBuffers`, `GetSecurityInfo`, `SetSecurityInfo`,
`GetSecurityDescriptorControl`, `GetAce` and `GetTokenInformation`. Export
presence is an availability observation, not a completed security owner.
The repository pins `pywin32==312`; its documented application environment is
the local `.venv` created by `setup.bat` with Windows CPython 3.14 x64 and the
requirements lock. This disposable checkout initially had no application
`.venv`; the initial test interpreter lacked `win32security`/`ntsecuritycon`.
That absence is not a claim about a correctly installed application environment.

Python path/stat checks and `mkdir(mode=0o700)` are not the verified Windows
owner/DACL contract. On the evaluated Windows stdlib, `O_NOFOLLOW` and
`O_DIRECTORY` are absent. Shell ACL text is not used as a security verifier.
The separate native owner uses pywin32 312 plus typed ctypes calls for
`FileIdInfo` and `GetVolumeInformationByHandleW`. Missing dependencies/APIs,
unsupported platforms or failed native observations fail closed.

`WindowsProtectedRootCharacterization` requires the same two explicit opt-ins,
an existing canonical disposable scope, and an exact purpose. It opens and pins
every ancestor, scope and target with `GENERIC_READ | READ_CONTROL`, no DELETE
sharing, and `OPEN_REPARSE_POINT | BACKUP_SEMANTICS`. Metadata-only desired access
did not fence rename in the first native characterization; requesting
`GENERIC_READ` establishes the tested sharing fence without reading contents.
Actual native tests now refuse both live root and scope rename attempts.

File identity uses `FileIdInfo`'s 64-bit volume and 128-bit file ID, compared with
the approved path's Python identity. Legacy `GetFileInformationByHandle`'s
32-bit volume serial did not match Python's volume identity. Reparse/directory/
hardlink attributes and final path are inspected on the same opened object.
The final handle path must match the selected path, be non-UNC, and report
`DRIVE_FIXED`; a mapped remote drive cannot pass merely by reporting NTFS.
The same handle's volume must report NTFS and persistent ACL support.

The writable scope and every existing intermediate directory through the selected
target must **already** have protected current-user-only DACLs. Ancestors above the
approved scope remain pinned for path checks without imposing this ACL policy.
No existing scope, intermediate directory or target is repaired.
`provision_journal_for_characterization` chooses
one new UUID private-journal child and supplies a protected owner-only DACL
atomically to exclusive `CreateDirectory`. A collision is an error, never a
repair/overwrite. If subsequent verification fails, new evidence is retained;
no cleanup occurs. There is no provisioning method for assets or selected JSON.
`capture_for_characterization` only opens existing purpose paths read-only.

The native verifier reads owner and complete bounded DACL through `GetSecurityInfo`
on that handle, requires the current process-token user as owner, a protected
non-null DACL, and only explicit basic owner allow entries with `FILE_ALL_ACCESS`
and optional object/container inheritance flags. Inherited, other-principal,
deny/object/callback or unmodeled ACEs are unsupported/unsafe. Thread impersonation
is unsupported. Token/group/privilege cases outside this narrow owner-only model
are not accepted as a general effective-access proof. No privilege is enabled.
The complete in-scope chain's descriptor and identity observations are retained
and rechecked before returning the private owner. Each readiness call compares
every pinned in-scope handle's ACL and identity with those original observations,
checks the paths for identity/reparse changes, and rechecks the target filesystem.
Even a change to another supported owner-only ACL invalidates the observation.

The native projection can report `owner_only_acl_observed` and `acl_verified=true`
for this snapshot while handles remain open. Closing releases handles and changes
the projection to closed/unverified; it never deletes the root. Paths/SIDs remain
private. No native observation authenticates same-user writers, verifies content,
establishes directory durability, grants current authorization or makes overall
`protected_storage_available` true. Existing production owners remain unchanged.

`AclPolicySample` is explicitly synthetic. The conservative model requires
an exact current-user owner SID, present protected DACL and bounded explicit
owner-only allow entries with modeled file rights. Inherited entries,
Everyone/Users/other principals (including SYSTEM in this narrow model), changed
owner, absent/null DACL and unprotected inheritance are unsafe. Unmodeled ACE
kinds, masks or malformed/unbounded inputs are unsupported.
`compatible_model_only` still has `acl_verified=false` and cannot be passed into
readiness to upgrade any gate. A future policy may review additional system
principals; this model approves none implicitly.

Microsoft's [GetSecurityInfo contract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/aclapi/nf-aclapi-getsecurityinfo)
retrieves a descriptor through a handle and describes race limitations.
[CreateFileW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew)
defines open/handle semantics a later backend must validate. OS APIs are
available; supported protected-storage implementation is not established here.

## Write, replacement and durability characterization

`characterize_write_boundary` interprets the existing offline writer's ordered
flush/fsync, replacement and acknowledgment boundaries without performing them.
Disposable tests exercise the actual C2B-8A writer with injected fsync failure
and interruptions before replace and after replace before acknowledgment:

| Boundary | Observable state | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File sync fails / before replacement | Old complete file, or no first revision; temp evidence may remain | Unacknowledged, pinned writer, no retry |
| After replacement before acknowledgment | Complete new file may be visible | Ambiguous acknowledgment, no replay or effect-success inference |
| Acknowledged and reopened | New revision observed in that process | No directory durability, power-loss or cross-file transaction guarantee |

Current owners do not establish a supported parent-directory persistence barrier
on Windows. File `fsync` and `os.replace` do not by themselves prove a persisted
directory entry under hardware/power failure. Journal, staging asset, promoted
asset and selected JSON remain separate writes. A matching new journal cannot
acknowledge separate remote submission, Candidate registration or JSON save.
[FlushFileBuffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-flushfilebuffers)
documents file/volume flushing; this foundation performs no volume flush or
administrative operation and claims no portable directory-fsync equivalent.

The native owner's narrow ACL observation supports only a verified local fixed
NTFS handle. ReFS, FAT/exFAT, remote shares, mapped drives and unknown filesystems
are unsupported. The path/stat owner has no filesystem verification. Even a
successful native NTFS ACL observation lacks overall protected-storage readiness;
directory durability remains `unsupported`, and execution stays closed.

## Protected Journal lifecycle (C2B-8C-2)

`WindowsProtectedJournalCharacterization.provision_for_characterization` requires
both explicit opt-ins, delegates private-directory creation to the native root
owner, and retains its complete pinned ancestor chain until explicit close.
The host supplies the disposable scope independently. The resulting native root
identity must equal the separately captured `ApprovedRoot`; Journal paths never
construct authority. Only this newly provisioned owner may initialize one private
writer. Its process-local lock serializes operations; exclusive native file
creation still fences competing writers for the same operation.

The ordinary `OfflineJournalWriter` retains its existing public constructor and
default filesystem behavior. Three private I/O methods permit the disposable
subclass to create lock and temporary files with `CREATE_NEW` and the same
protected current-user-only DACL at creation, verify observed file identities,
and release only its acknowledged live lock. Existing file ACLs are never repaired.
The temporary inode and its DACL move to the final Journal name on replacement.
Native tests inspect real lock, temporary and final file security descriptors.

Before and after initialization, append, reopen, inventory and Human Recovery
inspection, the host rechecks the pinned root chain, filesystem and bounded direct
child files. Native file checks reject reparses, multiple links, unsupported DACLs
and changed observed ACLs. They hold handles while inspecting and revalidating the
snapshot; all opened file handles are released afterward so the existing atomic
replacement can proceed. Direct-child inspection is limited to 64 entries and
fails closed above that bound rather than inspecting a partial set as safe.
The initial created-file ACL snapshot is retained before the creation fault seam;
changing it to another otherwise supported owner-only DACL still invalidates the
observation. Post-operation verification also runs when a read or parse fails.

Inside an append, checks surround exclusive lock/temp creation, precede replacement
after file flush/fsync, follow the final reread and surround verified lock release.
The fault seams characterize file creation, pre-replace, post-replace/pre-ACK and
operation-return boundaries. These are bounded observations, not handle-relative
file content I/O or a proof against hostile same-user check/use races. Retained
directory handles fence the tested directory substitutions. No claim of complete
same-user file-writer isolation or continuous ACL protection is made.

Every failed append pins its writer uncertain with no retry. Pre-replace failures
retain old complete bytes, lock and temporary evidence; post-replace failures can
leave complete new bytes and unknown acknowledgment. Failed post-operation
verification withholds the return value and cannot count as a successful write.
No stale-lock takeover, temp cleanup, uncertain-evidence deletion or automatic
replay is performed. Releasing the unchanged lock after an acknowledged live
append is the normal writer operation, not recovery cleanup. File fsync and
replacement do not establish directory/power-loss durability or a transaction
with assets or Project JSON.

Closing native handles invalidates the entire lifecycle. A host may explicitly
reopen an independently selected Journal directory through fresh native root
verification. That owner exposes inspection only and cannot initialize a writer.
Reopened records remain `authenticity=unverified` / `trust=inspect_only`.
Human Recovery returns only its existing bounded projection, not a retained case
or decision owner. An original selected Project root is separately supplied;
missing Projects and incomplete or rolled-back Journals remain inspection
findings. Native protection applies to the Journal directory/files only, not an
independently supplied Project or asset root. This slice does not inspect assets.

ACL snapshots, original producer observations, digest-chain integrity, separately
supplied expected revision/digest, independently authenticated authorship, trusted
latest-head custody and current Project/session authorization remain different
evidence. A digest-valid older prefix is not detectable without an independently
retained expected tip, and even that tip does not authenticate an author.
`execution_available=False`, `protected_storage_available=False` and
`authorship=unverified` remain unchanged. No keys, HMAC, DPAPI, network, worker,
Candidate mutation, Project save, Start or Recovery execution are introduced.

## Validation and remaining production gates

Focused disposable tests cover explicit/unapproved/overlapping purposes, Windows
and non-Windows fail-closed status, redaction, scope/root/file substitutions,
symlink/reparse ancestor/file observations, actual hardlinks, unsafe/inherited
principals, modeled/unmodeled ACLs, fsync failure, old/new file interruptions,
ambiguous acknowledgment, digest-valid forgery, rollback and Human Recovery
inspect-only behavior. True native Windows tests separately cover atomic secured
private-journal creation, same-handle descriptor/identity inspection, read-only
existing-root inspection, fully protected nested directory/JSON inspection,
live scope/intermediate/root rename refusal, writable intermediate principals,
inheritance/unsupported ACEs, and intermediate ACL changes during capture or
readiness (including changed owner-only snapshots). They also cover actual Everyone
and inheritance ACL changes, unsupported/mapped filesystems, absent dependencies,
unapproved paths and retained evidence after post-creation interruption.
Synthetic ACL/reparse samples are distinguished from these native tests. The
existing publication symlink test may skip when Windows disallows symlink creation;
no successful native junction or general hostile-race guarantee is inferred.

Before production activation, separately review and integrate protected-root
ownership for journal/containment/promotion, approved scope provisioning and
child-file ACL propagation; expand native substitution/ACE/race validation in
the locked Windows environment and define supported long-lived handle lifecycles;
establish file/replacement/directory durability; define authenticated ownership
and independently trusted latest-head custody; and re-establish fresh human
recovery authorization. Quota/retention, approved cleanup, real transport,
worker lifecycle, Human Start and original-host publication/save gates from
C2B-7 still apply. This characterization grants none of them.
